# Important Commands and Command Combinations and Files in linux
_Best book to learn about basics of linux commands is :_
***THE LINUX COMMAND LINE (TLCL)***
## Some Important command combinations and concepts
1. list of directory  contents with their size and sort them in descending order
	```Bash
	du -sh ./* | sort -hr
	```
	for `du` command `-s`  is an very important flag  

2. **Make your pendrive bootable**   
Insert your USB drive and identify its device name. You can find it by running:

	```Bash
	lsblk
	```
	Unmount the USB drive if it's automatically mounted:  

	```Bash
	sudo umount /dev/sdX1  # Replace X with your USB drive letter
	# In my case  it was 'a'
	sudo umount /dev/sda1
	```
	use `dd` to copy the ISO image to the USB drive. Replace `/path/to/your.iso` with the path to your ISO file and `/dev/sdX` with the device name of your USB drive	
	```Bash
	sudo dd if=/path/to/your.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
	```  

3. _Important Note_ : with flatpak no need to use sudo while working with flatpak unless you want to install app system-wide for all users  

4. ***NetworkManager Commands***
	```Bash
	nmcli radio wifi [ on | off ]
	nmcli device wifi list
	nmcli connection show
	```
	
5. why do we use `make` utility instead of  we can simply use bash installation script 
	1. **Automatic Dependency Management** : One of the main advantages of using `make` is **automatic dependency tracking**. `make` automatically rebuilds targets only when their dependencies have changed. For example, if you only modify a single `.c` file, `make` will only recompile that file and its dependencies, instead of recompiling everything. This can save a significant amount of time, especially in large projects.

	1. **Parallelization of Tasks** : `make` can automatically parallelize tasks, making use of multiple CPU cores. For example, `make -j` allows `make` to run multiple compilation steps concurrently, speeding up the build process, especially for large projects with many independent tasks.
